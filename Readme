Introduction

In this project, we created an appication called **"Similar Image Generator"** that generates a similar image for the given picture. This can be achieved by either selecting the picture from a local machine or retrieve an image from the Facebook account of the user using "GraphAPI Tool" and the selected picture will send to Google cloud vision API, Based on the object, facial expressions, text detected in the image by API, it will generate labels. Using those labels this app provides similar images realted to the labels.
